# Spotify Assistant

A Spotify assistant built on top of Chainlit that helps users create playlists, search for tracks by genre, add tracks to playlists, and retrieve playlist IDs. This project leverages the Spotify API, ChatOpenAI, LangChain, and Langgraph to provide a conversational interface for interacting with Spotify.
